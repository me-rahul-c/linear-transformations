"# linear-transformations" 
#   l i n e a r - t r a n s f o r m a t i o n s 

*Go through lecture08.pdf for theory details

*Concepts used : Linear algebra(linear transformation)

*Tool(s) used : MATLAB

*Here transformation matrix alters the 2D vectors

*So output obtained is based on the transformation matrix values(the basis vectors)

*Determinant of transformation matrix tells us how much area changed during linear transformation.

  if det = 0 ==> No area in output image
  
  if det = 1 ==> No change in image area
  
  if det = x(say 4) ==> image area is increased by 4 times

*Running the code:

1.Open .m file in MATLAB software

2.Run file 

3.Try changing the elements of transformation matrix to to double,flip etc the image
